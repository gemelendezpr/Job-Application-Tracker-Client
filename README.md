# Interview Lens

Interview Lens is a community-driven web application designed to help job seekers prepare for interviews by leveraging shared experiences. Users who have undergone interviews can post detailed accounts of their interview experiences, including the job position, company, location, interviewer, and personal insights. These posts are aggregated into a searchable feed, enabling other users to filter by company name, job title, or location, giving them direct access to relevant interview insights.

The application aims to reduce the time spent searching for interview tips across the web by creating a centralized platform where users can create, read, update, and delete their interview experiences. This fosters a supportive ecosystem where individuals can benefit from shared knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of interview trends at specific companies or for particular roles.
## Features

## Purpose
